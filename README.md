# Rock Paper Scissors Console Game

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, intended to run in the web browser console. The user plays against the computer in a best-of-five format, with each round's outcome displayed in the console. The primary goal of this project is to apply JavaScript basics, such as functions, loops, and conditionals, while managing the game logic and user interactions through the console.

## Features
- **Console-Based Interaction**: Users interact with the game entirely through the web browser's console.
- **Computer Opponent**: The game features a computer opponent that randomly selects between rock, paper, or scissors.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the user's and computer's scores throughout the five-round match.
- **Result Announcement**: After each round, the game announces the winner and the current score in the console.

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied JavaScript to create a program that runs in the web browser console.
- Practiced creating functions to handle the core game operations.
- Used basic JavaScript to process user input and produce game outcomes.
- Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills through the development and testing phases of the project.
- Employed version control systems by initiating, committing, and managing project code within a Git repository.
